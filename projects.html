                    <p class="section-description">
                       This project was a group assignment where we were given a set of RGB colors and were to make use of some heuristics and meta-heuristics to reduce the "distance" between each color point. This is akin to the Travelling Salesman Problem. Here the "points" were color values and it was implemented for a set of 100 colors and 500 colors. This project implemented a Greedy Constructive Heuristic, and a Single Start and Multi-Start Variant of the Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing heuristics respectively.

                       This was a project where we were provided with a dataset of consisting of a subset of the Ling-Spam corpus. This dataset was organized neatly into Spam and Non-Spam and we were to use classifier models from the Sci-Kit Learn framework to classify spam from non-spam emails with a respectable degree of accuracy. Additionally, we were encouraged to use models of our own choosing other than the Support Vector Machine (SVM) perscribed for the assignment and an additional dataset of our choice to see how the model performs on data that was not prepared for us. As such, this project uses a subset of the Enron spam email corpus that was organized into spam and non-spam and processed for duplicate files. This project uses the Linear SVM, Random Forest Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier provided within this framework.

                        Java RMI based Token Ring Network
                    </h5>
                    <p class="section-description">
                       This project was from our Distributed Systems and Concurrency course. Here we were to implement a token passing network in Java using JavaRMI. This was an extension on some of the laboratory practicals we were guided through during the course. This version is missing one function where one would pass a "kill" token through the network to shut down every node and exit the process. This will be implemented in the future once I am back at my main desktop.
