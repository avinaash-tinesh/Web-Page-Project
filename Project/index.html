                        Hi! My name is Avinaash Tinesh and I am currently a student at the University of Stirling. I am enrolled in the
                        Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Software Engineering degree course. I have always been interested in technology which inevitably led me to pursuing this degree. Here, you will find
                        what I have been learning in my time in the University and some of the Projects I have done as part
                        of my assignments, these will be updated as I do new and interesting things!

                        Software Engineering in the University of Stirling. So far, I have done modules such as<!-- in Data Structures, Objects and Algorithms,
                        Systems and Managing Information in my second year, where we learned about the concepts of Object
                        Orientated Programming, in Managing Information, we learned how to receive input from a .csv file
                        and print out information to a text file and creating a .svg file for both a pie chart and bar graph
                        and we learned some basic C in Systems. -->

                        In my past semester of my third year I did the modules Software Engineering I, Databases Principles and Applications, and
                        Multimedia and Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI). We did a few projects this semester, a web application
                        (a.k.a a website), <!-- linked
                        <a href="http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~ast/n5-assignment">here</a> --> it is VERY arbitrary and VERY MUCH a prototype, however it allowed me to wet my feet in web dev, a group project where we designed a software
                        system for a fictional company (which will be implemented in the coming semester, with the same group
                        members) and making a little database in mySQL from some information provided in an assignment brief.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description" id="section-b-description">
                        The group project involved some use of UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams and
                        the creation of a basic Software Requirements Document. Other than that, the Database module also
                        introduced me to some basic Java to use with SQL.
